# Spotify Playlist Downloader
One of my side projects was createing this thing called spotify playlisy downloader in university i had a trial of spotify and when it ran out i was too cheap to buy spotify i didn't have any money but i had 400 plus songs in my playlist i didn't want to lose all that so i created a python program that uses the spotify api to get those songs and then youtube's api to download the mp3 version now i had all the same music but for free.
