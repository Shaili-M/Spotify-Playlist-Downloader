# Spotify Playlist Downloader
One of my side projects was creating this thing called Spotify playlist downloader in university I had a trial of Spotify and when it ran out I was too cheap to buy Spotify I didn't have any money but I had 400 plus songs in my playlist I didn't want to lose all that so I created a python program that uses the Spotify API to get those songs and then YouTube's API to download the mp3 version now I had all the same music but for free.

So now NO NEED OF SPOTIFY PREMIUM!ðŸ™Œ
